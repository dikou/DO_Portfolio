		<b>Welcome to my online space!</b><br>  My name is Diana and I'm a junior pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information at the University of Michigan School of Information.  I'm currently interested in focusing my studies on User Experience Design. 

		I was born and raised in the Sunshine State.  I'm proud to be from Gainesville, home of the University of Florida Gators, but I ultimately bleed maize and blue.
