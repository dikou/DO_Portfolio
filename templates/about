		I was born in the college town of Gainesville where I grew up with kids who had parents trying to get their PhDs.  Once I finished elementary school, I moved to Saint Augustine, the oldest city in America.  Having lived in sleepy suburbs filled with retirees for so long, I wanted to get out of Florida for my four years in college.  So I came to Ann Arbor to meet new types of people and experience living in snow. I'm hoping to live in a fast-paced metropolitan city when I graduate.  Despite the unforutunate fact that I experience nausea on long plane rides (6+ hours), I enjoy travelling to new places. Here are places I want to visit:</p>
		
			<ul class="travel">
			<li>California</li> 
			<li>Dallas & Austin, Texas</li>
			<li>Seattle, Washington</li>
			<li>Chicago, Illinois</li>
			<li>Europe</li>
			</ul>
