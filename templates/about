		I was born in the college town of Gainesville where I grew up with kids who had parents trying to get their PhDs.  Once I finished elementary school, I moved to Saint Augustine, the oldest city in America.  Having lived in sleepy suburbs filled with retirees for so long, I wanted to get out of Florida for my four years in college.  So I came to Ann Arbor to meet new types of people and experience living in snow.

		I like creating things but couldn't tell you how I plan to make that desire into a career at this point.
